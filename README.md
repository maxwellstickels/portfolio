## Overview

This site is the start of my career portfolio, which will serve as a hub for my future works in web development. Links to my Scratch game are used as placeholders for future projects. Besides the Published Works section, there is an About Me section at the top of the page, which provides details about what inspired me to learn web development, and a Contact Info section which links to my email and LinkedIn profile.

## Programs Used
This website was designed with HTML 5 and CSS 3.0, and refactored in Visual Studio Code 1.54.2.
